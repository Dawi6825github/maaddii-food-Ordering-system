# Migration Plan to React Native Expo

## Plan for Migration to React Native Expo:

1. **Update `App.js`**:
   - Ensure that the structure remains compatible with Expo. No significant changes are expected.

2. **Modify `index.js`**:
   - Change the registration method from `AppRegistry.registerComponent` to `registerRootComponent` from Expo.

3. **Revise `app.json`**:
   - Update the file to include necessary Expo configurations:
     - Add an `expo` object with properties such as:
       - `slug`: A unique identifier for the app.
       - `version`: The version of the app.
       - `orientation`: The orientation of the app (e.g., "portrait").
       - `icon`: Path to the app icon.
       - `splash`: Configuration for the splash screen.
       - `updates`: Configuration for over-the-air updates.

4. **Review `babel.config.js`**:
   - Confirm that it is set to use the React Native Babel preset, which is already correct.

5. **Check `metro.config.js`**:
   - Ensure that any custom configurations needed for Expo are included. The current setup should work.

6. **Verify `.eslintrc.js`**:
   - Confirm that it extends the ESLint configuration for React Native, which is compatible with Expo.

7. **Check `jest.config.js`**:
   - Ensure it uses the React Native preset, which is already correct.

## Follow-Up Steps:
- After making the changes, test the application to ensure it runs correctly with Expo.
- Verify that all functionalities are intact and that the app behaves as expected.
